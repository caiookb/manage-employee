# Employee Manager Frontend

React App created to manage employees on your company.

Application running on  [this link](https://caiookb.github.io/nutcache-challenge-CaioSilva/)

I used the  [Fake API CrudCrud](https://crudcrud.com/) for this application but a backend was built for using this app either for further deployments, you can check it here [Employee API](https://github.com/caiookb/employeeapi).
